<!-- GIVEN I am taking a code quiz
WHEN I click the start button
THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question -->

the timer starts on button press and ends when the test ends or time is up

<!-- WHEN I answer a question
THEN I am presented with another question -->

buttons with modular text were used to show the answer choices to the questions

<!--
WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
THEN time is subtracted from the clock -->

an if statement checks to see the answer is right/wrong then subtracts time from the timer by 10 seconds if answered incorrectly

<!-- WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0 -->
<!-- THEN the game is over -->
<!-- WHEN the game is over -->
<!-- THEN I can save my initials and score -->

Highscore page was made but a work in progress
